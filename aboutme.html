        <p class="indent aboutme">I am Jamal Hawkins. I was born and raised in Clarksdale, MS then moved to Nashville, TN when I was 12 years old. First, I found a passion for building things because of my handy grandfather. From middle school to high school, I saw myself as being an engineer especially because I had a passion for math. After attending a robotics camp in high school, I found my true passion in coding. I find it interesting to identify a problem and determine a solution by making proper code/product. After high school, I furthered my education at Tennessee State University and received a bachelor degree in Computer Science in May of 2021. From then, I began to work as an IT Support Specialist at Vanderbilt University and also enrolled in Pivot Tech coding boot camp to strengthen my coding skills.</p>
        
        <p class="indent aboutme">During my free time, I enjoy gaming, traveling, and watching sports. Mainly football and basketball which were the main sports of my childhood that I enjoy. I also enjoy swimming in the ocean, riding horses, hiking, and other outdoor activities. I also have a passion for reading novels and listening to music. I’m a hardworking, considerate, and driven individual who doesn’t mind helping others. I am very excited to get an opportunity to start a career as a developer. I look forward to meeting and working with you.</p>
